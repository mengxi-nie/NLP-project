" Predictions suggesting that large changes in weight will accumulate
indefinitely in response to small sustained lifestyle modifications rely on the
half-century-old 3,500 calorie rule , which equates a weight alteration of 2.2 lb to
a 3,500 calories cumulative deficit or increment , " write the study authors Dr.
Jampolis , Dr. Chaudry , and Prof. Harlen , from N.P.C Clinic in OH . The 3,500-
calorie rule " predicts that a person who increases daily energy expenditure by
100 calories by walking 1 mile per day " will lose 50 pounds over five years , the
authors say . But the true weight loss is only about 10 pounds if calorie intake
doesn 't increase , " because changes in mass ... alter the energy requirements
of the body 's make-up . " " This is a myth , strictly speaking , but the smaller
amount of weight loss achieved with small changes is clinically significant and
should not be discounted , " says Dr. Melina Jampolis , CNN diet and fitness
expert .
